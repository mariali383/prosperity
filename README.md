1. Data exploration (understand data...)  
2. Split the data and choose features needed for algorithm
3. Code up look forward period (after period of time, sell no matter what)
4. Choose targets (how long to hold it for - iterations)
5. 

Components
1. Backtester
2. Test own features and theories (exponential moving weighted average, different look back periods, realised vol)
3. 

Strategies
1. lead lag - market sentinment
2. pairs trading
3. 

Models
1. Linear Regression
2.

2. Researching and creating features (Geoffrey)
3. Study data provided (EDA)
4. Create template to create and test features quickly (Geoffrey)
5. Data cleaning (Geoffrey)
